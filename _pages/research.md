## Anxiety and depression among Canadian undergraduates with decreased sound tolerance
Using a large primary dataset of Canadian undergraduates (N = 2,095), we show that those with clinically significant levels of the auditory perception disorder *misophonia* score higher on measures of depression (δ = .61) and anxiety (δ = .63) than those with non-clinical misophonia. This effect holds for *hyperacusis*, another auditory perception disorder: as hyperacusis severity increases, so does anxiety (ρ = .52) and depression (ρ = .41).

## The effect of visual angle on slot machine gambling in virtual reality
Explores how modifying the low-level stimulus property *visual angle* alters gambling behaviours when using a virtual reality slot machine. We argue that although visual angle does not appear to affect gambling in VR, the behavioural impacts of other low-level stimulus features (e.g., colour, brightness) should be explored so that gamblers' decision-making is not exploited through simple stimulus manipulations.
