### Anxiety and depression among Canadian undergraduates with decreased sound tolerance

Status: Under review

Using a large primary dataset of Canadian undergraduates (N = 2,095), we show that those with clinically significant levels of the auditory perception disorder *misophonia* score higher on measures of depression (*δ* = .61) and anxiety (*δ* = .63) than those with non-clinical misophonia. This effect holds for *hyperacusis*, another auditory perception disorder: as hyperacusis severity increases, so does anxiety (*ρ* = .52) and depression (*ρ* = .41).

### The effect of visual angle on slot machine gambling in virtual reality

Status: In preparation

Explores how modifying the low-level stimulus property *visual angle* alters gambling behaviours when using a virtual reality slot machine. We argue that although visual angle does not appear to affect gambling in VR, the behavioural impacts of other low-level stimulus features (e.g., colour, brightness) should be explored so that gamblers' decision-making is not exploited through simple stimulus manipulations.

Note: The PDF below represents an initial conceptualization of my undergraduate thesis. A revised, methodologically focused paper is currently under development using these data.
