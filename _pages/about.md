Hello! I'm Carter.

I am a human cognition researcher and a cognitive psychology graduate student at the University of Waterloo.

Recently, I joined Dr. Clara Colombatto's Vision and Cognition Laboratory, where I study the role of the human visual system in social perception.

Previously, I was in Dr. Nichole Scheerer's Cognisant Laboratory at Wilfrid Laurier University, where I completed an undergraduate thesis in cognitive neuroscience, exploring how altering the size of a virtual reality slot machine influences gambling behaviours.

This website includes my research projects, some data analysis projects I am proud of, and (perhaps) some of my non-scientific writing.

I am always happy to chat. Please feel free to contact me at carter.smith@uwaterloo.ca
