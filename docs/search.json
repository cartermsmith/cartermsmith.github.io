    "section": "",
    "text": "Using a large primary dataset of Canadian undergraduates (N = 2,095), we show that those with clinically significant levels of the auditory perception disorder misophonia score higher on measures of depression (δ = .61) and anxiety (δ = .63) than those with non-clinical misophonia. This effect holds for hyperacusis, another auditory perception disorder: as hyperacusis severity increases, so does anxiety (ρ = .52) and depression (ρ = .41).\n\n\n\nUndergraduates from Wilfrid Laurier University completed various questionnaires. They completed the Duke Misophonia Questionnaire (DMQ), the Duke-Vanderbilt Misophonia Questionnaire (DVMQ), the Inventory of Hyperacusis Symptoms (IHS), the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), and the Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI).\nWe then explored how their self-reported misophonia and hyperacusis levels correlated with their self-reported depression and anxiety levels. We employed non-parametric analyses of variance (ANOVA; Kruskal-Wallis rank sum test) and correlations (Spearman’s ρ).\nTo evaluate our effects, we mainly relied on effect size measures since null hypothesis significance testing will yield p &lt; .05 when N is large (in our case, N = 2,095).\n\n\n\nThe investigation of how DST subcategories correlate with mental health difficulties was timely since psychometrically validated measures of misophonia have recently been developed (DMQ and DVMQ), yet their relation to depression and anxiety had not been explored.\nUnderstanding how these aligned measures mapped onto mental health struggles can help highlight intervention strategies that can perhaps be implemented by stakeholders in universities.\n\n\n\nThis work was conducted by myself and my colleagues in the Department of Psychology at Wilfrid Laurier University: Natalia Van Esch, a current MSc student, and Cognisant Lab director and Assistant Professor, Dr. Nichole E. Scheerer.\nOther folks in the Cognisant Lab also provided helpful discussion and feedback on this project, undoubtedly increasing the quality of the work.\n\n\n\nSmith, C.

Further, I explore how these cues may influence an observers’ cognition (e.g., their attention).\nIn the past, I have studied the auditory conditions misophonia and hyperacusis and their association with depression and anxiety. I have also worked with virtual reality to explore how modifying stimulus properties (e.g., slot machine size) alters gambling behaviours.\nI am passionate about philosophy, cycling, music, and the Toronto Blue Jays.\nPlease feel free to contact me at: carter.smith@uwaterloo.ca.\nCheck out my research\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo matching items\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo matching items\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo matching items"
