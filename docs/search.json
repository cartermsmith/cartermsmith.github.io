    "section": "",
    "text": "Using a large primary dataset of Canadian undergraduates (N = 2,095), we show that those with clinically significant levels of the auditory perception disorder misophonia score higher on measures of depression (δ = .61) and anxiety (δ = .63) than those with non-clinical misophonia. This effect holds for hyperacusis, another auditory perception disorder: as hyperacusis severity increases, so does anxiety (ρ = .52) and depression (ρ = .41).\n\n\n\nUndergraduates from Wilfrid Laurier University completed various questionnaires. They completed the Duke Misophonia Questionnaire (DMQ; Rosenthal et al., 2021), the Duke-Vanderbilt Misophonia Questionnaire (DVMQ; Williams et al., 2022), the Inventory of Hyperacusis Symptoms (IHS; Greenberg & Carlos, 2018), the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI; Beck, 1961), and the Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI; Beck et al., 1988).\nWe then explored how their self-reported misophonia and hyperacusis levels correlated with their self-reported depression and anxiety levels. We employed non-parametric analyses of variance (ANOVA; Kruskal-Wallis rank sum test) and correlations (Spearman’s ρ).\nTo evaluate our effects, we mainly relied on effect size measures since null hypothesis significance testing will yield p &lt; .05 when N is large (in our case, N = 2,095).\n\n\n\nThe investigation of how DST subcategories correlate with mental health difficulties was timely since psychometrically validated measures of misophonia have recently been developed (DMQ and DVMQ), yet their relation to depression and anxiety had not been explored.\nUnderstanding how these aligned measures mapped onto mental health struggles can help highlight intervention strategies that can perhaps be implemented by stakeholders in universities.\n\n\n\nThis work was conducted by myself and my colleagues in the Department of Psychology at Wilfrid Laurier University: Natalia Van Esch, a current MSc student, and Cognisant Lab director and Assistant Professor, Dr. Nichole E.

    "title": "The effect of visual angle on slot machine gambling in virtual reality",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Read my undergraduate thesis here!\n\n\nCheck out my poster from SOBDR 2025 here!\n\n\nWhat did we do?\nThis research project comprises my undergraduate thesis at Wilfrid Laurier University.\nThis work was conducted explored how modifying the low-level stimulus property visual angle alters gambling behaviours when using a virtual reality slot machine.\nWe argue that although visual angle does not appear to affect gambling in VR, the behavioural impacts of other low-level stimulus features (e.g., colour, brightness) should be explored so that gamblers’ decision-making is not exploited through simple stimulus manipulations.\n\n\nHow did we do it?\nUndergraduates from Wilfrid Laurier University completed an experiment wherein they gambled using a virtual reality slot machine that had both a high and low visual angle.\nParticipants wore a physiological tracker, the EmotiBit, which approximated autonomic arousal through measurements of heart rate variability, galvanic skin conductance, skin conductance responses, heart rate, and more.\nGambling persistence (gambling past a specified end-point), and post-reinforcement pauses (time taken between each spin of the slot machine) were the dependent variables.\n\n\nWhy did we do it?\nThis research draws on a classic theory from Dr. Antonio Damasio, a neuroscientist who postulated that arousal influences decision-making (Damasio, 1996). This theory originates from his work with frontal-brain-damaged patients who showed decision deficiencies during economic games, which supposedly stemmed from inadequate arousal levels (Damasio, 1996).\nWe hypothesized that participants who experienced greater autonomic arousal would make better gambling choices. The slot machine’s visual angle was the purported mechanism by which autonomic arousal would change, such that higher visual angles lead to higher levels of arousal, and vice versa (e.g., Gall & Latoschik, 2023).\nOther work has explored the role of visual angle’s influence on behaviour, but had not used an adequate gambling measure to assess how arousal may alter gambling (e.g., Oberdörfer et al., 2023). We aimed to fill these gaps.\n\n\nWho contributed?\nThis study was conducted by myself and my undergraduate advisor, Dr. Nichole E. Scheerer. Dr. Scheerer is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Psychology and director of the Cognisant Lab at Wilfrid Laurier University.\n\n\nReferences\nDamasio, A. (1996).

Further, I explore how these cues may influence an observers’ cognition (e.g., their attention).\nIn the past, I have studied the auditory conditions misophonia and hyperacusis and their association with depression and anxiety. I have also worked with virtual reality to explore how modifying stimulus properties (e.g., slot machine size) alters gambling behaviours.\nI am passionate about philosophy, cycling, music, and the Toronto Blue Jays.\nPlease feel free to contact me at: carter.smith@uwaterloo.ca.\nCheck out my research\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo matching items\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo matching items\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo matching items"

    "text": "Check out the open-access paper here\n\nWhat did we do?\nUsing a large primary dataset of Canadian undergraduates (N = 2,095), we show that those with clinically significant levels of the auditory perception disorder misophonia score higher on measures of depression (δ = .61) and anxiety (δ = .63) than those with non-clinical misophonia. This effect holds for hyperacusis, another auditory perception disorder: as hyperacusis severity increases, so does anxiety (ρ = .52) and depression (ρ = .41).\n\n\nHow did we do it?\nUndergraduates from Wilfrid Laurier University completed various questionnaires. They completed the Duke Misophonia Questionnaire (DMQ), the Duke-Vanderbilt Misophonia Questionnaire (DVMQ), the Inventory of Hyperacusis Symptoms (IHS), the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), and the Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI).\nWe then explored how their self-reported misophonia and hyperacusis levels correlated with their self-reported depression and anxiety levels. We employed non-parametric analyses of variance (ANOVA; Kruskal-Wallis rank sum test) and correlations (Spearman’s ρ).\nTo evaluate our effects, we mainly relied on effect size measures since null hypothesis significance testing will yield p &lt; .05 when N is large (in our case, N = 2,095).\n\n\nWhy did we do it?\nThe investigation of how DST subcategories correlate with mental health difficulties was timely since psychometrically validated measures of misophonia have recently been developed (DMQ and DVMQ), yet their relation to depression and anxiety had not been explored.\nUnderstanding how these aligned measures mapped onto mental health struggles can help highlight intervention strategies that can perhaps be implemented by stakeholders in universities.\n\n\nWho contributed?\nThis work was conducted by myself and my colleagues in the Department of Psychology at Wilfrid Laurier University: Natalia Van Esch, a current MSc student, and Cognisant Lab director and Assistant Professor, Dr. Nichole E. Scheerer.\nOther folks in the Cognisant Lab also provided helpful discussion and feedback on this project, undoubtedly increasing the quality of the work.\n\n\nCite the work:\nSmith, C.
