Explores how modifying the low-level stimulus property *visual angle* alters gambling behaviours when using a virtual reality slot machine. We argue that although visual angle does not appear to affect gambling in VR, the behavioural impacts of other low-level stimulus features (e.g., colour, brightness) should be explored so that gamblers' decision-making is not exploited through simple stimulus manipulations.
