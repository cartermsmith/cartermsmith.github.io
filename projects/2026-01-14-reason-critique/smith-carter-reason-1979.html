<h2>In this talk, I plan to:</h2>
<p>Outline the historical context and procedure of Reason (1979) 1 .</p>
<p>Examine Reason’s predictive framework.</p>
<p>Internally critique it.</p>
<p>State the implications.</p>
<p>Begin a discussion re: these implications.</p>
</section>
<section id="slide-3" class="slide level2">
<h2>Historical context and procedure</h2>
<p>Reason is situated in a historically important position.</p>
<p>In the throes of the cognitive revolution (beginning in late 1950s) 2
.</p>
<p>The historical context allows for an expanded research focus.</p>
<p>Studies inattention by gathering a descriptive account of
actions-not-as-planned (ANAPs).</p>
</section>
<section id="slide-4" class="slide level2">
<h2>Reason’s explanatory leap</h2>
<p>Reason asks: </p>
<p>After gathering descriptive knowledge about test failures…</p>
<p>(1) when do test failures occur? </p>
<p>If we know when, (2) can we predict which  kind  of test failure will
occur?</p>
</section>
<section id="slide-5" class="slide level2">
<h2>Reason’s first hypothesis, formally</h2>
<p>P1 : There exists an  open-loop motor mechanism  that is active when
highly practiced, skilled behaviours are conducted.</p>
<p>P2 : There exist  critical decision points , situations that rely on
two or more motor programs.</p>
<p>P3 :  If  an active open-loop motor mechanism meets a critical
decision point, and:</p>
<p>P4 :  If  competing motor programs have different strengths:</p>
<p>C : A  test failure  will occur. </p>
<p>Note a missing premise: the conducted motor program must misalign
with the circumstances.</p>
</section>
<section id="slide-6" class="slide level2">
<h2>Reason’s second hypothesis, formally</h2>
<p>P1 :  If  a situation allows for a test failure to occur.</p>
<p>P2 : The failure is determined by the motor program’s strength, such
that:</p>
<p>P3 : The strongest erroneous motor program will win out.</p>
<p>C : We can predict the  kind  of failure by knowing motor program
strength once an error is made.</p>
</section>
<section id="slide-7" class="slide level2">
<h2>Mini-discussion</h2>
<p>Should we accept this?</p>
<p>I argue we should not.</p>
</section>
<section id="slide-8" class="slide level2">
<h2>A formal internal critique</h2>
<p>P1: Assume  ex ante  Car &lt; Garden; Reason’s hypothesis is
supported.</p>
<p>P2: Assume  ex ante  Car &gt; Garden; Reason’s hypothesis is
contradicted.</p>
<p>C1 : Absent  ex ante  strengths, both options remain
indeterminate.</p>
<p>P3:  Reason holds that behavioural history (e.g., recency, frequency)
increases a motor program’s strength.</p>
<p>P4: Strength is inferred  post-hoc , then used for prediction.</p>
<p>C2 : As stated, the hypothesis is  post-hoc , risking
unfalsifiability.</p>
<p>Thus : Any predictive account must provide  ex-ante  measures
that:</p>
<p>Pre-specify how behaviours (or non-behaviours!) map to strength.</p>
</section>
<section id="slide-9" class="slide level2">
<h2>Implications and discussion</h2>
<p>How  could we determine if our pre-specified criteria map onto motor
program strength? Can this mapping be tested empirically ?</p>
<p>Could a more robust account of prior strengths allow for a purely
motor explanation for test failures?</p>
</section>
<section id="slide-10" class="slide level2">
<h2>Implications and discussion</h2>
<p>What are the methodological limitations of diary studies?</p>
<p>Reason states that, since ANAPs can be so functionally similar to
their intended behaviour, they may go undetected for some time. Can we
rely on Reason’s data as truly reflecting the base rate of ANAPs, beyond
what is noticed by the participants?</p>
<p>What are the problems with Reason’s ANAP framework being (seemingly)
unsystematic?</p>
</section>
<section id="slide-11" class="slide level2">
<h2>Implications and discussion</h2>
<p>Reason provides two mechanistic explanations for ANAPs (CL and OL)
yet also inserts agency into the equation.</p>
<p>Why believe that the CL, another mechanistic system, maps onto
volition or free choice at all?</p>
<p>If mechanistic systems explain apparent volition, what does this tell
us about how free our choices are?</p>
